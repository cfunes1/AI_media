0.12: today I just want to take you to my
1.64: first impression of using claw 3.5
3.719: sonnet so basically I thought we just
5.44: try to code a game uh in react with uh
8.519: 3.5 so this means that we can kind of
11.16: testt out this artifacts feature too uh
14.04: I kind of want to create a kind of an
15.759: interactive game and I want to add
17.68: Sprites from mid journey I want to add
19.72: in some music from sunno maybe udio add
22.76: some sound effects from 11 labs and put
25.8: all of that together only by using 3.5
28.56: Sonet can I call me Game Dev after that
31.519: let's see how this works out and at the
33.6: end I kind of want to do my quick first
35.68: impressions of working with claw 3.5
38.0: Sonet let's just get going okay so let
40.16: me just walk you quickly through kind of
41.6: my game IDE so basically I want this
44.2: kind of boxing glove here right so we
47.28: can just uh yeah do something like this
49.36: so let's just call it red boxing glove
52.359: uh I want kind of the ball just to sit
55.199: on top of the glow right so we have this
57.8: ball here and yeah we need some kind of
60.76: box and I kind of want uh
63.439: clicks so we can kind of count the
65.76: number of clicks right from the mouse or
68.32: the I guess the iPad or something and I
71.4: kind of want the height to be displayed
74.4: so we want to count that right uh let's
77.24: say we have zero we have maybe 10 I
79.96: don't know what the value and the idea
82.72: is let's say you have three seconds to
86.72: kind of Click as many times as you can
89.759: here here and the more times you click
92.399: the more power we generate up here and
95.24: the higher the ball will go so it's
98.119: basically some kind of skill game uh but
100.759: I kind of want scale it so if you can
103.24: click more times you will get more power
105.6: and the ball will fly higher so yeah we
108.439: want to implement some real physics I
110.759: was thinking maybe adding some kind of
112.799: balloons here with water in them so we
115.92: can fly through those we'll see but that
118.2: is basically the idea for the game so
119.68: let's see if we can transfer this over
122.119: to CLA 3.5 sonnet and kind of into our
125.159: game yeah so okay so I went ahead I
127.28: cleaned kind of up the UI how I wanted
129.399: so let's just grab like kind of a
131.16: screenshot of this now right so let's
133.76: just copy our screenshot here and then
136.4: we can head over to CLA R and let's kind
139.68: of start our chat and let's call it
142.36: something like I don't know the punch
146.48: game right so let's start with that
150.36: okay so I just want to start by pasting
152.72: in the UI I want for this I think this
155.4: might be a bit much to take on right
157.72: away but uh I want to try it and see
160.599: kind of where we can go from there so
162.519: let me just come up with my prompt now
164.64: and then we can see kind of where we can
166.519: go from if this is too much to do or if
169.319: you have to break down into smaller
171.08: steps but uh let's give it a shot then
173.92: okay so I'm just going to read out the
175.08: prompt if you want to skip it that's
176.36: fine but yeah I want to create a game in
178.72: react I have uploaded a simple but
179.959: sketch of an UI as an image yeah like we
182.0: did here on a high level the game should
184.159: work as follows the user aims the glow
187.12: at the ball with the mouse movement and
188.84: clicks the mouse as many times as
190.64: possible in 3 seconds for each click
193.28: more power is generated when the time
196.0: runs out the boxing low punches the ball
198.36: with amount of built up power the ball
201.44: will of course travel the longer the
203.0: more power it gets punched with the UI
206.12: will track the number of clicks and
207.44: height of the ball in real time the aim
209.48: of the game is simple punch the ball as
211.56: high as possible on a lower level we
214.439: have some more important details
215.72: regarding the physics of the game okay
218.159: so this is a bit important because this
219.84: is kind of what makes the game right so
222.04: number one the ball must behave with
223.64: real physics AKA Gravity the weight of
226.879: the ball is around 350 G that's kind of
229.519: like a soccer ball uh number two the
231.799: weight of the boxing glow is 300 G the
234.48: impact angle of the glow on the ball
237.28: will of course reduce or improve the
239.519: power power transferred from the glow uh
241.92: to the ball kind of like a hitbox style
244.56: air resistance will also affect the ball
246.68: right so let's start by writing the
249.92: first iteration of the punch game so
252.079: kind of now I want to focus on the
253.56: mechanics we will fix the UI later so
255.959: add Sprites and stuff so now I just want
258.519: to see where this takes us and is this
260.799: too much is this uh kind of the right
264.199: amount of instructions it might be a bit
266.44: too much we might have to break it down
267.8: to smaller steps but yeah let's just
270.08: find out okay so let me zoom in a bit
272.4: here so now we basically have the game
275.68: mechanics so we can start the game by
277.44: clicking here okay so we have to click
279.4: as fast as you can so we're going to
280.56: count the clicks so boom you can see we
283.52: simulated the ball it went 94 M and then
287.72: he kind of came uh down again uh ball
291.32: punched to okay so we didn't record that
294.199: so we might have to fix that so let me
296.36: try to fix that we need to store how
299.12: high we punch the ball before we kind of
301.68: move into the UI visual part right okay
304.84: so to kind of do that I just went we
306.28: need to store how high the ball travel
307.8: in so I kind of find the line of the
309.68: code here so that's ball punch to kind
312.039: of the ball height right uh as this play
314.56: to the max height of the ball uh so we
316.68: kind of want to keep that uh variable
318.639: stored in our display here so we can
321.28: kind of see how actually High we managed
323.68: to punch it so you're right we should
325.96: track the maximum height of the ball
327.759: which is yeah so that's good so let's
329.96: see if we can implement this feature so
332.0: now we can kind of see how high did we
334.6: actually punch it so let's try it again
336.84: so start the game click as fast as you
338.44: can 3 seconds and
341.84: boom okay so we just got a static but
344.68: that's fine so hopefully with this yeah
347.4: so now you can see we got ball punch to
349.8: a maximum height of 98.24%
360.16: and actually create the UI for this now
363.08: because yeah we want a glow we want a
365.6: ball we want to see it right so let's
368.08: try to do that okay so then I moved on
369.88: to kind of great job now that we have
371.28: our physics simul engine let's move on
373.08: to the UI part I want to see the boxing
374.72: glow the UI as we sketch it in the image
377.639: right uh with physics simulation engine
380.88: to power the game can you write the
382.68: first iteration of the UI for a punching
385.28: game so let's try that okay so we got
387.24: something back here this looks
388.319: interesting so let me see now so I want
390.68: to click Start game I can't move the
392.599: boxing GL I almost couldn't click okay
395.08: so yeah that seemed to work pretty good
397.84: five 4 that was quite high that seemed a
401.44: bit high but uh yeah we don't have any
403.759: way to restart the game so let's try
406.199: that again so we start it we
408.639: click and boom here goes the ball
413.84: 588 uh okay that's a good start but I
416.599: think we can improve on this okay so
418.639: let's do some incremental adjustment so
420.8: I just took a screenshot of what we have
422.56: so far uh okay good start but let's make
425.039: some changes I want the starting point
426.72: of the ball to be right over the boxing
428.36: glow hovering in the air I also want to
430.599: be able to move the boxing glow um with
432.919: the mouse horizontally Let's uh up the
435.8: timer to 5 Seconds okay so now let's try
438.599: it so uh okay perfect so we can move
441.039: this you can see the timer going down
443.039: I'm clicking so let's try to hit an
444.639: angle here okay so you can see that
446.96: travel uh to the left right so that's
449.0: perfect
450.08: okay so we need a reset game button I
452.36: think other than that this is looking
454.479: great to be honest so let's add a few
456.479: more things and yeah I kind of want to
459.52: move the timer I think below the box and
462.919: let's add a reset button so basically a
465.72: few more things I want to add a u timer
467.28: below the box and add a reset game
469.039: button yes that looks perfect so now
471.0: let's try it so let's start this so I
472.68: want to kind of test what uh is going to
474.84: impact the height if I click now around
476.919: 25 clicks so this was a bit of an angle
480.199: so that was 858 now let's try to hit the
482.919: ball straight on with 26 clicks and see
486.159: if it goes higher than 858 so that is
489.0: going of uh try to check our physical uh
492.759: engine right so it was
494.479: 268 okay so I yeah I I can't really
498.28: remember so we got 30 m longer but
500.44: that's fine doesn't matter too much okay
502.68: so I'm very happy with this I think we
504.319: can actually just move on now and start
507.0: adding some more uis to this I want to
508.879: add some spr from mid journey and kind
510.879: of make it look a bit nicer so I just
513.8: went I'm happy with the code I want to
515.599: move this project into my vs code so
517.32: let's start by creating a react app for
518.919: this using vs code and the terminal so
521.56: let's just run this and hopefully we
523.2: will get this yeah create a react app
526.12: right and then we can kind of initialize
528.519: it and maybe install some tailwind and
530.6: stuff and see where this can takes us so
534.24: if we that was pretty quick that was a
536.16: fast answer so yeah we want to create
539.079: our app so let's just copy this let's
541.16: head over to our vs code Studio I just
543.68: created a new folder so let's just call
545.839: it punch game right so let's fire up
548.2: this and kind of get our react app
550.56: installed here it's going to take a few
553.0: seconds maybe a couple of minutes so
555.16: let's just let this run okay so that was
557.24: finished now we let's head back to clae
559.959: Let's CD into our um project right let's
564.48: clear that let's go back here and let's
567.44: see uh okay so we have opened that right
570.959: and now we kind of want to replace our
572.959: appjs in source so I'm just going to
575.88: copy this code here let's head back here
578.839: let's follow this down Source appjs
581.68: let's replace this right okay
585.279: good and now we kind of want to install
588.24: some tail win here that's fine let's go
591.8: back here install some tail win and
594.68: let's grab this right okay just a few
598.72: steps here should be pretty quick
601.76: okay uh now we want to go into our
604.2: Tailwind config J as so let's open that
607.92: we can find this replace that save it
611.12: right good replace the components of uh
616.12: Source index. CSS we can do that let's
619.64: just find here and let's bring that on
622.92: top right okay
626.279: great very good stepbystep explanation
629.64: here by uh uh son 3.5 make sure index.
634.399: CSS
635.959: imported right so we can copy this
638.76: pasting that right save it okay so that
641.2: should be all set up only what we need
643.24: now is to kind of yeah get our code into
646.44: this so we can just go how should I
647.959: Implement our game code into react app
650.079: in vs code right pretty easy step so we
653.639: should go to our source folder we should
655.2: name it punch game.js right so let's do
658.32: that so let's let go to Source uh new
661.72: file uh punch game.js right okay so in
665.959: the artifact section here now we have
667.959: something called code here so we can
670.2: just copy that pretty simple to use
672.68: actually let's head back to our vs code
675.279: Studio let's save our punch game and
678.2: let's see if there was there any other
679.639: instructions maybe we should update our
683.639: app.js we can do that
686.24: app.js let's update that that looks good
689.6: I think we actually are ready to run now
691.639: so let's stop this clear mpm start right
696.76: and let's fire up our Port 3,000 and see
699.92: if we have our game here yes perfect so
702.24: we can start it we can click and this
705.76: should work pretty good and boom here we
708.639: go so the next part now is of course
710.72: going to be to do some adjustments get
712.88: some Sprites and let's make this game a
715.76: bit more interesting okay so the next
717.44: prompt is going to be great now let's
718.72: start adding some some Sprites to the
719.88: game I want to add a Sprite to the ball
721.519: ball Sprite PNG and the boxing glow glow
724.04: Sprite PNG I've uploaded the image so we
726.399: can test the code here before moving to
728.0: vs code implement the first iteration of
730.2: the Sprite addition to the game please
732.16: so I went to Mid journey I created this
734.88: Sprite so I kind of wanted this Poke
736.76: Ball here as the ball and I created this
739.92: glow I thought it was pretty cool so I
741.72: went over to cona I added this here so
743.959: we're going to download this uh with
746.959: transparent background right okay that's
749.32: the first Sprite here's the ball Sprite
751.72: so let's download this with the
753.6: transparent background right checked out
756.519: and that should be our Sprite so we can
758.44: go back to clae and let me just upload
761.44: this images okay so we have our Sprites
764.199: here uh they don't look transparent but
766.199: I think they are so let's just run this
768.199: now and see can we get these Sprites
770.079: into our code okay so we have our code
772.399: back here so yeah I think this should
774.199: work you can see there's a bug here now
775.639: we don't see the images but that should
777.24: be a pretty easy effect because we have
779.6: to ensure that our bold Sprite PNG glob
781.76: Sprite PNG are placed in the public
783.639: folder in your react project right so
786.72: basically let's head over to vs code
789.0: Studio so if we update our react app now
791.839: you can see we have this but uh we don't
794.32: have the images so what we can do we
796.279: have to move these two uh images here
799.72: into our public folder right so move
802.56: that move that right and let's compile
806.56: that and I think we should be good to go
808.92: now so let's refresh yes perfect so now
811.56: you can see we have our Sprite we have
813.44: our boxing glove we can fire up this and
816.199: this should move that Pokeball right uh
819.56: yeah but that's pretty static let's try
821.76: to make the ball rotate at is the Sprite
825.88: rotate and let's make it a bit bigger so
829.6: let's try to do that over here on CLA
832.24: right so let's just try that works for
833.72: more immersion let's add some new
835.0: features I want the ball Sprite to
836.56: rotate in alignment with the physic
838.639: engine also make the ball and glow
840.399: Sprite 50% bigger so let's try to run
843.6: that and see if that could create a bit
846.079: more immersion than this this is a bit
848.48: static right okay so we have our code
851.04: back here so let's just copy the code
852.72: let's head back to V code Studio let's
854.8: replace this right let's compile it and
858.56: let's go to our react app let's refresh
861.24: this okay so you can see it's bigger but
864.399: we have to move the ball a bit but let's
866.16: see if the ball rotates now if we punch
868.759: it
869.8: yeah perfect so that's pretty cool so
872.0: that gives a bit more immersion you can
873.8: see it's spinning around here but that's
875.519: fine so we can reset game let's just
877.68: move the ball a bit higher and I think
880.079: we should be pretty much good to go we
882.88: have to add some backgrounds and that's
884.68: pretty much our simple game right okay
886.959: so I'm pretty happy now I want to add
888.519: some final touches so let me add some
890.959: punching sounds to be played when the
893.0: timer runs out so that's going to be
894.36: punch MP3 and some background music
897.04: music MP3 let's write the first
899.6: first iteration of our code please and
901.399: write the full new updated code so the
904.24: next step then is going to be to create
905.959: this punching sound and we need some
908.24: background music and we have tools for
910.16: that uh now of course we can just head
913.24: over to so I went to 11 Labs the sound
917.04: effects Library I just did punching
918.959: sounds so I kind of did this one so
921.0: let's have a quick
922.24: listen I think that was pretty good and
924.839: I went to sunno and I just put in like 8
927.72: bit Nintendo style video game track
929.6: chill music and I found this one I think
932.48: I like this
935.18: [Music]
939.279: one that's pretty catchy right so let's
941.959: try to implement those two things into
944.24: our game for even more immersion so yeah
947.56: so let's see how this goes okay so we
949.92: have our code here so I'm just going to
951.519: copy the code uh let's head back to vs
954.0: code Studio let me paste in this and
956.0: there's a few more things we have to do
957.92: right we have to actually place our
960.639: files into the correct folder so let me
963.639: just set that up and let's see if it
965.36: worked okay so I move the MP3 files here
968.88: into a public folder so let's compile
970.68: that let's go back to our react app
973.44: let's refresh this and let's hear it now
976.12: I don't know the volume might be pretty
978.0: loud so let's hope it's not too
981.279: loud okay so that's working let's hear
984.0: the punching
986.839: sound couldn't hear it
993.16: okay so we heard the punching sound was
994.6: way off so let's try to adjust that and
996.519: turn the volume down maybe like I think
998.639: we got to turn the volume down like 25%
1001.319: or something so let's do a few changes
1003.24: turn on the volume uh 25% also timing of
1005.639: the punch was way off it should play
1007.68: exactly when the 5sec time Runs Out
1009.92: Implement these changes right the full
1011.48: updated code pleas so yeah we are almost
1015.6: done I think so let's see if we can do
1017.279: this final tweaks and see if it works
1019.959: okay so let's try it again now see if
1022.079: that worked uh so let's try Okay so the
1025.079: music is lower that's good so let's see
1026.959: this punishing sound
1029.8: [Music]
1032.839: now that was way
1035.72: off okay so I actually think there's a a
1038.36: syn problem here so let's
1041.28: try uh the punching sound must be as I
1045.199: think it's not on point now so I try
1047.24: that and then we got this code so let me
1050.799: just copy that and see if that
1054.679: worked okay so let's compile that okay
1058.16: so start the game Let's refresh this
1060.039: let's click hopefully this works
1062.05: [Music]
1063.559: now yes perfect okay so I'm
1068.12: happy so I think the final thing I kind
1071.08: of want to do is actually add some kind
1073.919: of background so I was looking at
1076.24: something like this okay so I kind of
1078.4: ended up with this background image so
1080.28: this is kind of the Pokemon looking up
1082.32: and we got the big blue sky right okay
1084.52: so I tried to upload our background
1086.2: image that did not work because we
1088.12: couldn't upload more than five images so
1090.96: that is kind of a minus there might be
1092.44: some workarounds and now that but I
1094.159: decided just to open a new chat so I
1096.32: just uploaded the game code the
1097.64: background image I want to implement the
1099.24: background uh to my game adjust a code
1101.36: to dynamically show the full version of
1102.88: the image keep the canvas setting as it
1105.679: is now so let's just try that because I
1108.08: kind of want to
1109.4: keep the canvas as steady as possible
1111.88: not to ruin up the whole game now so
1114.36: let's just run this and see if this is
1117.08: going to work right okay so that seemed
1118.679: to work fine so let's see now I did a
1121.12: few more changes yes we implemented the
1123.96: background image that worked pretty good
1126.4: uh I wrote a few new code uh I wanted to
1129.28: change the font color to Black because
1131.559: it was kind of white on Blue so we
1133.36: couldn't really see it so we got that
1135.48: and the final change I made I just want
1137.84: to play the back music in a loop so it's
1140.679: not affected by the start or reset game
1143.48: that kind of brings you out of immersion
1145.2: right and that is pretty much it so I
1148.36: kind of think our game is finished now
1151.36: and let's uh fire it up one last time
1154.96: let's play it a bit and see kind of how
1156.96: it works and let's see how high I can
1159.2: actually get the ball to fly up in the
1161.919: air okay so let's compile this we can
1164.52: hear the music playing in the background
1166.679: and let's just play the game a bit and
1168.12: let me see how high I can get this okay
1171.4: so I'm just going to click so how much
1173.48: was
1175.0: that 33 so that was 11:30 so let's
1180.52: reset let me try again I'm so slow at
1184.44: [Music]
1186.679: this 37 so 12 12 29 I think I'm going to
1192.36: call it there so yeah I'm kind of happy
1195.32: how this turned out we could have added
1197.4: the music more and stuff but but yeah I
1200.12: like the Sprites I kind of like the
1202.32: Aesthetics and we have some kind of
1204.52: skill here right so yeah pretty cool so
1207.76: let me just stop this and let's do kind
1209.72: of a wrap up here overall this was a
1212.2: very smooth experience running 3.5 Sonet
1215.2: trying to create this simple game with
1217.28: react uh I love the artifacts feature I
1219.76: think that's going to bring a lot of
1221.12: people over to anthropic it's great to
1223.799: see this visual component on the code
1226.159: you're working on so that's a big props
1228.32: right uh they don't have the code
1230.32: interpreter feature yet so you can't
1231.799: actually execute scripts inside of the
1234.0: browser uh I think they will add that
1236.039: soon to be honest the pros were kind of
1239.159: everything I had said now it's smooth
1242.08: it's quick it does coding very well I
1244.64: would say it's kind of the best
1245.72: experience I have so far at least with
1247.559: coding so I think they up the not a bit
1250.08: there at least on gp4 level right and
1254.039: the cons is kind of the rate limit
1256.84: because you don't have that many
1258.039: requests if even though I'm paying $20
1260.28: hope they can improve that soon and I
1262.6: could only upload five images that was a
1265.2: bit annoying because I tried to be very
1267.48: visual here in this game creation
1269.84: process so another Pro uh on con was
1272.96: that we can only upload five images but
1275.279: we solve that by updating a new chat so
1276.799: there's a work on there I guess but
1278.44: overall my first impressions are great
1280.84: and very uh smooth experience working
1283.52: with 3.5 but I got some more exploring
1285.88: to do before I can kind of come back
1287.4: with my conclusion
1289.08: uh so I'm going to be Ming this for a
1290.52: few weeks now going forward and we can
1292.2: talk about it later I'm going to be
1293.72: using the API 2 so look out for that
1296.799: other than that thank you for tuning in
1298.48: hope you enjoyed this kind of in-depth
1299.919: step-by-step process creating yeah kind
1301.919: of a simple react game but some deep
1304.279: features I think so hope you took
1306.72: something from it come back for
1308.36: Wednesday I hope for more stuff like
1310.96: this like And subscribe give it a
1313.08: comment if you enjoy this model too and
1315.84: yeah see you again soon
