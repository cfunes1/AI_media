📋 Text Ranking (3 models)
    SUMMARY: Text Ranking is the task of ranking a set of texts based on their relevance to a query. Text ranking models are trained on large datasets of queries and relevant documents to learn how to rank documents based on their relevance to the query. This task is particularly useful for search engines and information retrieval systems.

📋 Token Classification (4 models)
    SUMMARY: Token classification is a natural language understanding task in which a label is assigned to some tokens in a text. Some popular token classification subtasks are Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Part-of-Speech (PoS) tagging. NER models could be trained to identify specific entities in a text, such as dates, individuals and places; and PoS tagging would identify, for example, which words in a text are verbs, nouns, and punctuation marks.
