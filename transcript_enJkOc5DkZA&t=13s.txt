       0.1: today I just want to take you to my
       1.6: first impression of using claw 3.5
       3.7: sonnet so basically I thought we just
       5.4: try to code a game uh in react with uh
       8.5: 3.5 so this means that we can kind of
      11.2: testt out this artifacts feature too uh
      14.0: I kind of want to create a kind of an
      15.8: interactive game and I want to add
      17.7: Sprites from mid journey I want to add
      19.7: in some music from sunno maybe udio add
      22.8: some sound effects from 11 labs and put
      25.8: all of that together only by using 3.5
      28.6: Sonet can I call me Game Dev after that
      31.5: let's see how this works out and at the
      33.6: end I kind of want to do my quick first
      35.7: impressions of working with claw 3.5
      38.0: Sonet let's just get going okay so let
      40.2: me just walk you quickly through kind of
      41.6: my game IDE so basically I want this
      44.2: kind of boxing glove here right so we
      47.3: can just uh yeah do something like this
      49.4: so let's just call it red boxing glove
      52.4: uh I want kind of the ball just to sit
      55.2: on top of the glow right so we have this
      57.8: ball here and yeah we need some kind of
      60.8: box and I kind of want uh
      63.4: clicks so we can kind of count the
      65.8: number of clicks right from the mouse or
      68.3: the I guess the iPad or something and I
      71.4: kind of want the height to be displayed
      74.4: so we want to count that right uh let's
      77.2: say we have zero we have maybe 10 I
      80.0: don't know what the value and the idea
      82.7: is let's say you have three seconds to
      86.7: kind of Click as many times as you can
      89.8: here here and the more times you click
      92.4: the more power we generate up here and
      95.2: the higher the ball will go so it's
      98.1: basically some kind of skill game uh but
     100.8: I kind of want scale it so if you can
     103.2: click more times you will get more power
     105.6: and the ball will fly higher so yeah we
     108.4: want to implement some real physics I
     110.8: was thinking maybe adding some kind of
     112.8: balloons here with water in them so we
     115.9: can fly through those we'll see but that
     118.2: is basically the idea for the game so
     119.7: let's see if we can transfer this over
     122.1: to CLA 3.5 sonnet and kind of into our
     125.2: game yeah so okay so I went ahead I
     127.3: cleaned kind of up the UI how I wanted
     129.4: so let's just grab like kind of a
     131.2: screenshot of this now right so let's
     133.8: just copy our screenshot here and then
     136.4: we can head over to CLA R and let's kind
     139.7: of start our chat and let's call it
     142.4: something like I don't know the punch
     146.5: game right so let's start with that
     150.4: okay so I just want to start by pasting
     152.7: in the UI I want for this I think this
     155.4: might be a bit much to take on right
     157.7: away but uh I want to try it and see
     160.6: kind of where we can go from there so
     162.5: let me just come up with my prompt now
     164.6: and then we can see kind of where we can
     166.5: go from if this is too much to do or if
     169.3: you have to break down into smaller
     171.1: steps but uh let's give it a shot then
     173.9: okay so I'm just going to read out the
     175.1: prompt if you want to skip it that's
     176.4: fine but yeah I want to create a game in
     178.7: react I have uploaded a simple but
     180.0: sketch of an UI as an image yeah like we
     182.0: did here on a high level the game should
     184.2: work as follows the user aims the glow
     187.1: at the ball with the mouse movement and
     188.8: clicks the mouse as many times as
     190.6: possible in 3 seconds for each click
     193.3: more power is generated when the time
     196.0: runs out the boxing low punches the ball
     198.4: with amount of built up power the ball
     201.4: will of course travel the longer the
     203.0: more power it gets punched with the UI
     206.1: will track the number of clicks and
     207.4: height of the ball in real time the aim
     209.5: of the game is simple punch the ball as
     211.6: high as possible on a lower level we
     214.4: have some more important details
     215.7: regarding the physics of the game okay
     218.2: so this is a bit important because this
     219.8: is kind of what makes the game right so
     222.0: number one the ball must behave with
     223.6: real physics AKA Gravity the weight of
     226.9: the ball is around 350 G that's kind of
     229.5: like a soccer ball uh number two the
     231.8: weight of the boxing glow is 300 G the
     234.5: impact angle of the glow on the ball
     237.3: will of course reduce or improve the
     239.5: power power transferred from the glow uh
     241.9: to the ball kind of like a hitbox style
     244.6: air resistance will also affect the ball
     246.7: right so let's start by writing the
     249.9: first iteration of the punch game so
     252.1: kind of now I want to focus on the
     253.6: mechanics we will fix the UI later so
     256.0: add Sprites and stuff so now I just want
     258.5: to see where this takes us and is this
     260.8: too much is this uh kind of the right
     264.2: amount of instructions it might be a bit
     266.4: too much we might have to break it down
     267.8: to smaller steps but yeah let's just
     270.1: find out okay so let me zoom in a bit
     272.4: here so now we basically have the game
     275.7: mechanics so we can start the game by
     277.4: clicking here okay so we have to click
     279.4: as fast as you can so we're going to
     280.6: count the clicks so boom you can see we
     283.5: simulated the ball it went 94 M and then
     287.7: he kind of came uh down again uh ball
     291.3: punched to okay so we didn't record that
     294.2: so we might have to fix that so let me
     296.4: try to fix that we need to store how
     299.1: high we punch the ball before we kind of
     301.7: move into the UI visual part right okay
     304.8: so to kind of do that I just went we
     306.3: need to store how high the ball travel
     307.8: in so I kind of find the line of the
     309.7: code here so that's ball punch to kind
     312.0: of the ball height right uh as this play
     314.6: to the max height of the ball uh so we
     316.7: kind of want to keep that uh variable
     318.6: stored in our display here so we can
     321.3: kind of see how actually High we managed
     323.7: to punch it so you're right we should
     326.0: track the maximum height of the ball
     327.8: which is yeah so that's good so let's
     330.0: see if we can implement this feature so
     332.0: now we can kind of see how high did we
     334.6: actually punch it so let's try it again
     336.8: so start the game click as fast as you
     338.4: can 3 seconds and
     341.8: boom okay so we just got a static but
     344.7: that's fine so hopefully with this yeah
     347.4: so now you can see we got ball punch to
     349.8: a maximum height of 98.24%
     360.2: and actually create the UI for this now
     363.1: because yeah we want a glow we want a
     365.6: ball we want to see it right so let's
     368.1: try to do that okay so then I moved on
     369.9: to kind of great job now that we have
     371.3: our physics simul engine let's move on
     373.1: to the UI part I want to see the boxing
     374.7: glow the UI as we sketch it in the image
     377.6: right uh with physics simulation engine
     380.9: to power the game can you write the
     382.7: first iteration of the UI for a punching
     385.3: game so let's try that okay so we got
     387.2: something back here this looks
     388.3: interesting so let me see now so I want
     390.7: to click Start game I can't move the
     392.6: boxing GL I almost couldn't click okay
     395.1: so yeah that seemed to work pretty good
     397.8: five 4 that was quite high that seemed a
     401.4: bit high but uh yeah we don't have any
     403.8: way to restart the game so let's try
     406.2: that again so we start it we
     408.6: click and boom here goes the ball
     413.8: 588 uh okay that's a good start but I
     416.6: think we can improve on this okay so
     418.6: let's do some incremental adjustment so
     420.8: I just took a screenshot of what we have
     422.6: so far uh okay good start but let's make
     425.0: some changes I want the starting point
     426.7: of the ball to be right over the boxing
     428.4: glow hovering in the air I also want to
     430.6: be able to move the boxing glow um with
     432.9: the mouse horizontally Let's uh up the
     435.8: timer to 5 Seconds okay so now let's try
     438.6: it so uh okay perfect so we can move
     441.0: this you can see the timer going down
     443.0: I'm clicking so let's try to hit an
     444.6: angle here okay so you can see that
     447.0: travel uh to the left right so that's
     449.0: perfect
     450.1: okay so we need a reset game button I
     452.4: think other than that this is looking
     454.5: great to be honest so let's add a few
     456.5: more things and yeah I kind of want to
     459.5: move the timer I think below the box and
     462.9: let's add a reset button so basically a
     465.7: few more things I want to add a u timer
     467.3: below the box and add a reset game
     469.0: button yes that looks perfect so now
     471.0: let's try it so let's start this so I
     472.7: want to kind of test what uh is going to
     474.8: impact the height if I click now around
     476.9: 25 clicks so this was a bit of an angle
     480.2: so that was 858 now let's try to hit the
     482.9: ball straight on with 26 clicks and see
     486.2: if it goes higher than 858 so that is
     489.0: going of uh try to check our physical uh
     492.8: engine right so it was
     494.5: 268 okay so I yeah I I can't really
     498.3: remember so we got 30 m longer but
     500.4: that's fine doesn't matter too much okay
     502.7: so I'm very happy with this I think we
     504.3: can actually just move on now and start
     507.0: adding some more uis to this I want to
     508.9: add some spr from mid journey and kind
     510.9: of make it look a bit nicer so I just
     513.8: went I'm happy with the code I want to
     515.6: move this project into my vs code so
     517.3: let's start by creating a react app for
     518.9: this using vs code and the terminal so
     521.6: let's just run this and hopefully we
     523.2: will get this yeah create a react app
     526.1: right and then we can kind of initialize
     528.5: it and maybe install some tailwind and
     530.6: stuff and see where this can takes us so
     534.2: if we that was pretty quick that was a
     536.2: fast answer so yeah we want to create
     539.1: our app so let's just copy this let's
     541.2: head over to our vs code Studio I just
     543.7: created a new folder so let's just call
     545.8: it punch game right so let's fire up
     548.2: this and kind of get our react app
     550.6: installed here it's going to take a few
     553.0: seconds maybe a couple of minutes so
     555.2: let's just let this run okay so that was
     557.2: finished now we let's head back to clae
     560.0: Let's CD into our um project right let's
     564.5: clear that let's go back here and let's
     567.4: see uh okay so we have opened that right
     571.0: and now we kind of want to replace our
     573.0: appjs in source so I'm just going to
     575.9: copy this code here let's head back here
     578.8: let's follow this down Source appjs
     581.7: let's replace this right okay
     585.3: good and now we kind of want to install
     588.2: some tail win here that's fine let's go
     591.8: back here install some tail win and
     594.7: let's grab this right okay just a few
     598.7: steps here should be pretty quick
     601.8: okay uh now we want to go into our
     604.2: Tailwind config J as so let's open that
     607.9: we can find this replace that save it
     611.1: right good replace the components of uh
     616.1: Source index. CSS we can do that let's
     619.6: just find here and let's bring that on
     622.9: top right okay
     626.3: great very good stepbystep explanation
     629.6: here by uh uh son 3.5 make sure index.
     634.4: CSS
     636.0: imported right so we can copy this
     638.8: pasting that right save it okay so that
     641.2: should be all set up only what we need
     643.2: now is to kind of yeah get our code into
     646.4: this so we can just go how should I
     648.0: Implement our game code into react app
     650.1: in vs code right pretty easy step so we
     653.6: should go to our source folder we should
     655.2: name it punch game.js right so let's do
     658.3: that so let's let go to Source uh new
     661.7: file uh punch game.js right okay so in
     666.0: the artifact section here now we have
     668.0: something called code here so we can
     670.2: just copy that pretty simple to use
     672.7: actually let's head back to our vs code
     675.3: Studio let's save our punch game and
     678.2: let's see if there was there any other
     679.6: instructions maybe we should update our
     683.6: app.js we can do that
     686.2: app.js let's update that that looks good
     689.6: I think we actually are ready to run now
     691.6: so let's stop this clear mpm start right
     696.8: and let's fire up our Port 3,000 and see
     699.9: if we have our game here yes perfect so
     702.2: we can start it we can click and this
     705.8: should work pretty good and boom here we
     708.6: go so the next part now is of course
     710.7: going to be to do some adjustments get
     712.9: some Sprites and let's make this game a
     715.8: bit more interesting okay so the next
     717.4: prompt is going to be great now let's
     718.7: start adding some some Sprites to the
     719.9: game I want to add a Sprite to the ball
     721.5: ball Sprite PNG and the boxing glow glow
     724.0: Sprite PNG I've uploaded the image so we
     726.4: can test the code here before moving to
     728.0: vs code implement the first iteration of
     730.2: the Sprite addition to the game please
     732.2: so I went to Mid journey I created this
     734.9: Sprite so I kind of wanted this Poke
     736.8: Ball here as the ball and I created this
     739.9: glow I thought it was pretty cool so I
     741.7: went over to cona I added this here so
     744.0: we're going to download this uh with
     747.0: transparent background right okay that's
     749.3: the first Sprite here's the ball Sprite
     751.7: so let's download this with the
     753.6: transparent background right checked out
     756.5: and that should be our Sprite so we can
     758.4: go back to clae and let me just upload
     761.4: this images okay so we have our Sprites
     764.2: here uh they don't look transparent but
     766.2: I think they are so let's just run this
     768.2: now and see can we get these Sprites
     770.1: into our code okay so we have our code
     772.4: back here so yeah I think this should
     774.2: work you can see there's a bug here now
     775.6: we don't see the images but that should
     777.2: be a pretty easy effect because we have
     779.6: to ensure that our bold Sprite PNG glob
     781.8: Sprite PNG are placed in the public
     783.6: folder in your react project right so
     786.7: basically let's head over to vs code
     789.0: Studio so if we update our react app now
     791.8: you can see we have this but uh we don't
     794.3: have the images so what we can do we
     796.3: have to move these two uh images here
     799.7: into our public folder right so move
     802.6: that move that right and let's compile
     806.6: that and I think we should be good to go
     808.9: now so let's refresh yes perfect so now
     811.6: you can see we have our Sprite we have
     813.4: our boxing glove we can fire up this and
     816.2: this should move that Pokeball right uh
     819.6: yeah but that's pretty static let's try
     821.8: to make the ball rotate at is the Sprite
     825.9: rotate and let's make it a bit bigger so
     829.6: let's try to do that over here on CLA
     832.2: right so let's just try that works for
     833.7: more immersion let's add some new
     835.0: features I want the ball Sprite to
     836.6: rotate in alignment with the physic
     838.6: engine also make the ball and glow
     840.4: Sprite 50% bigger so let's try to run
     843.6: that and see if that could create a bit
     846.1: more immersion than this this is a bit
     848.5: static right okay so we have our code
     851.0: back here so let's just copy the code
     852.7: let's head back to V code Studio let's
     854.8: replace this right let's compile it and
     858.6: let's go to our react app let's refresh
     861.2: this okay so you can see it's bigger but
     864.4: we have to move the ball a bit but let's
     866.2: see if the ball rotates now if we punch
     868.8: it
     869.8: yeah perfect so that's pretty cool so
     872.0: that gives a bit more immersion you can
     873.8: see it's spinning around here but that's
     875.5: fine so we can reset game let's just
     877.7: move the ball a bit higher and I think
     880.1: we should be pretty much good to go we
     882.9: have to add some backgrounds and that's
     884.7: pretty much our simple game right okay
     887.0: so I'm pretty happy now I want to add
     888.5: some final touches so let me add some
     891.0: punching sounds to be played when the
     893.0: timer runs out so that's going to be
     894.4: punch MP3 and some background music
     897.0: music MP3 let's write the first
     899.6: first iteration of our code please and
     901.4: write the full new updated code so the
     904.2: next step then is going to be to create
     906.0: this punching sound and we need some
     908.2: background music and we have tools for
     910.2: that uh now of course we can just head
     913.2: over to so I went to 11 Labs the sound
     917.0: effects Library I just did punching
     919.0: sounds so I kind of did this one so
     921.0: let's have a quick
     922.2: listen I think that was pretty good and
     924.8: I went to sunno and I just put in like 8
     927.7: bit Nintendo style video game track
     929.6: chill music and I found this one I think
     932.5: I like this
     935.2: [Music]
     939.3: one that's pretty catchy right so let's
     942.0: try to implement those two things into
     944.2: our game for even more immersion so yeah
     947.6: so let's see how this goes okay so we
     949.9: have our code here so I'm just going to
     951.5: copy the code uh let's head back to vs
     954.0: code Studio let me paste in this and
     956.0: there's a few more things we have to do
     957.9: right we have to actually place our
     960.6: files into the correct folder so let me
     963.6: just set that up and let's see if it
     965.4: worked okay so I move the MP3 files here
     968.9: into a public folder so let's compile
     970.7: that let's go back to our react app
     973.4: let's refresh this and let's hear it now
     976.1: I don't know the volume might be pretty
     978.0: loud so let's hope it's not too
     981.3: loud okay so that's working let's hear
     984.0: the punching
     986.8: sound couldn't hear it
     993.2: okay so we heard the punching sound was
     994.6: way off so let's try to adjust that and
     996.5: turn the volume down maybe like I think
     998.6: we got to turn the volume down like 25%
    1001.3: or something so let's do a few changes
    1003.2: turn on the volume uh 25% also timing of
    1005.6: the punch was way off it should play
    1007.7: exactly when the 5sec time Runs Out
    1009.9: Implement these changes right the full
    1011.5: updated code pleas so yeah we are almost
    1015.6: done I think so let's see if we can do
    1017.3: this final tweaks and see if it works
    1020.0: okay so let's try it again now see if
    1022.1: that worked uh so let's try Okay so the
    1025.1: music is lower that's good so let's see
    1027.0: this punishing sound
    1029.8: [Music]
    1032.8: now that was way
    1035.7: off okay so I actually think there's a a
    1038.4: syn problem here so let's
    1041.3: try uh the punching sound must be as I
    1045.2: think it's not on point now so I try
    1047.2: that and then we got this code so let me
    1050.8: just copy that and see if that
    1054.7: worked okay so let's compile that okay
    1058.2: so start the game Let's refresh this
    1060.0: let's click hopefully this works
    1062.0: [Music]
    1063.6: now yes perfect okay so I'm
    1068.1: happy so I think the final thing I kind
    1071.1: of want to do is actually add some kind
    1073.9: of background so I was looking at
    1076.2: something like this okay so I kind of
    1078.4: ended up with this background image so
    1080.3: this is kind of the Pokemon looking up
    1082.3: and we got the big blue sky right okay
    1084.5: so I tried to upload our background
    1086.2: image that did not work because we
    1088.1: couldn't upload more than five images so
    1091.0: that is kind of a minus there might be
    1092.4: some workarounds and now that but I
    1094.2: decided just to open a new chat so I
    1096.3: just uploaded the game code the
    1097.6: background image I want to implement the
    1099.2: background uh to my game adjust a code
    1101.4: to dynamically show the full version of
    1102.9: the image keep the canvas setting as it
    1105.7: is now so let's just try that because I
    1108.1: kind of want to
    1109.4: keep the canvas as steady as possible
    1111.9: not to ruin up the whole game now so
    1114.4: let's just run this and see if this is
    1117.1: going to work right okay so that seemed
    1118.7: to work fine so let's see now I did a
    1121.1: few more changes yes we implemented the
    1124.0: background image that worked pretty good
    1126.4: uh I wrote a few new code uh I wanted to
    1129.3: change the font color to Black because
    1131.6: it was kind of white on Blue so we
    1133.4: couldn't really see it so we got that
    1135.5: and the final change I made I just want
    1137.8: to play the back music in a loop so it's
    1140.7: not affected by the start or reset game
    1143.5: that kind of brings you out of immersion
    1145.2: right and that is pretty much it so I
    1148.4: kind of think our game is finished now
    1151.4: and let's uh fire it up one last time
    1155.0: let's play it a bit and see kind of how
    1157.0: it works and let's see how high I can
    1159.2: actually get the ball to fly up in the
    1161.9: air okay so let's compile this we can
    1164.5: hear the music playing in the background
    1166.7: and let's just play the game a bit and
    1168.1: let me see how high I can get this okay
    1171.4: so I'm just going to click so how much
    1173.5: was
    1175.0: that 33 so that was 11:30 so let's
    1180.5: reset let me try again I'm so slow at
    1184.4: [Music]
    1186.7: this 37 so 12 12 29 I think I'm going to
    1192.4: call it there so yeah I'm kind of happy
    1195.3: how this turned out we could have added
    1197.4: the music more and stuff but but yeah I
    1200.1: like the Sprites I kind of like the
    1202.3: Aesthetics and we have some kind of
    1204.5: skill here right so yeah pretty cool so
    1207.8: let me just stop this and let's do kind
    1209.7: of a wrap up here overall this was a
    1212.2: very smooth experience running 3.5 Sonet
    1215.2: trying to create this simple game with
    1217.3: react uh I love the artifacts feature I
    1219.8: think that's going to bring a lot of
    1221.1: people over to anthropic it's great to
    1223.8: see this visual component on the code
    1226.2: you're working on so that's a big props
    1228.3: right uh they don't have the code
    1230.3: interpreter feature yet so you can't
    1231.8: actually execute scripts inside of the
    1234.0: browser uh I think they will add that
    1236.0: soon to be honest the pros were kind of
    1239.2: everything I had said now it's smooth
    1242.1: it's quick it does coding very well I
    1244.6: would say it's kind of the best
    1245.7: experience I have so far at least with
    1247.6: coding so I think they up the not a bit
    1250.1: there at least on gp4 level right and
    1254.0: the cons is kind of the rate limit
    1256.8: because you don't have that many
    1258.0: requests if even though I'm paying $20
    1260.3: hope they can improve that soon and I
    1262.6: could only upload five images that was a
    1265.2: bit annoying because I tried to be very
    1267.5: visual here in this game creation
    1269.8: process so another Pro uh on con was
    1273.0: that we can only upload five images but
    1275.3: we solve that by updating a new chat so
    1276.8: there's a work on there I guess but
    1278.4: overall my first impressions are great
    1280.8: and very uh smooth experience working
    1283.5: with 3.5 but I got some more exploring
    1285.9: to do before I can kind of come back
    1287.4: with my conclusion
    1289.1: uh so I'm going to be Ming this for a
    1290.5: few weeks now going forward and we can
    1292.2: talk about it later I'm going to be
    1293.7: using the API 2 so look out for that
    1296.8: other than that thank you for tuning in
    1298.5: hope you enjoyed this kind of in-depth
    1299.9: step-by-step process creating yeah kind
    1301.9: of a simple react game but some deep
    1304.3: features I think so hope you took
    1306.7: something from it come back for
    1308.4: Wednesday I hope for more stuff like
    1311.0: this like And subscribe give it a
    1313.1: comment if you enjoy this model too and
    1315.8: yeah see you again soon
