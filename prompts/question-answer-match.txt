 
Please create a table matching the interview questions below with relevant stories from the "latest stories" document. 
Format as follows: 
No introductory paragraph explaining work, just the results in table format.
Use tabs between columns (no extra spaces)
No blank lines between rows
No blank lines between questions
Include these columns: 
	• Question ID
	• Question
	• Story# (simple counter for stories per question, arranged from highest to lowest match strength)
	• Story (name from the document list below)
	• Match strength (5=Perfect, 4=Strong, 3=Good but needs adaptation, 2=Weak, 1=Very weak)
	• Rationale (brief explanation of why this story matches. No need to restate the match strength categories)
If NO stories match the question at all, include only one row with: 
	• Question ID
	• Question
	• Story# = 0
	• Story = "No match"
	• Match strength = 0
	• Rationale = Brief explanation of why no stories match
If there are many strong or perfect matches, make sure to include them all up to 4. 
Otherwise, include all relevant stories with match strength 1-5, omitting any "No match" rows
