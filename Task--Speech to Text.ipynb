    "\n",
    "Whisper is trained in a similar fashion to the original GPT, using self-supervised learning with a next-token prediction objective. However, while GPT is trained solely on text, Whisper is trained on paired audio and text, where the model learns to generate transcriptions (or translations) token by token from audio inputs. During training, the encoder processes the audio into latent representations, and the decoder learns to predict the next text token given the previous tokens and the audio context. Unlike GPT, which relies purely on textual continuity, Whisper must also learn alignment between speech and language, making it a multimodal model trained end-to-end on large-scale audio-text datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Whisper's internal processing is limited to a context window of approximately 30 seconds (specifically, around 1500 frames or ~30 sec of audio at 16 kHz). For audio longer than 30 seconds, Whisper slices the audio into multiple segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each initial segment of 30 secs, the original sound wave is transformed into a mel spectrogram that captures the log-scaled intensity in each of 80 mel-frequency bands, every 10 ms. Each time step is calculated by analyzing a 25 ms window of audio starting at that time step."

      "text=\" Why Stripe? Well, the mission of increasing the GDP of the internet and the key role Stripe plays for small companies in particular really resonate with me. And here is why. The last several years have been all about big tech, right? Particularly the largest players, the Magnificent Seven. That's nice because I have some Nvidia shares. But in the long term, that kind of concentration of economic growth is not good for the country or the world. This is something Patrick and John Collison probably agree with because I saw them talking about that in a podcast. But I believe that we're entering a new era where AI will enable smaller companies and startups to compete more effectively and regain their key role in the economy. Stripe's role in providing these businesses with trust and access to enterprise-grade financial infrastructure will be critical in this new era. In other words, we need Stripe to ensure that the benefits of AI spread across the entire world. So that's at a high level. In terms of the specific role, there are a couple of things I love. First, this position focuses on internal customers in finance, accounting, and treasury. And I am sure some people may strongly prefer having external customers, more standard products. But you know what? Throughout my career, I've found that the kind of intimacy you can build with internal customers is very special. You get to really understand the value of the product. And that can lead to very impactful and long-lasting solutions. At PNC, for example, I developed a custom CRM system for the trade finance team that they loved so much. They kept using it for 15 years. So having internal customers is actually a positive for me. Second, I think AI will drive most of the product innovation in the next 10 years. This is going to be true everywhere, but particularly in financial services, where data plays such a key role. I have seen early results of this at Amazon, where the team used machine learning to build a cash forecasting tool that blew the old tool out of the water and ran in 30 mins instead of 8 hours. That tool won the Adam Smith Award for Best Cash Flow Forecasting Solution in 2023. You can check it out. And I personally envisioned machine learning tools to detect anomalies in the timing and the content of bank statements coming from banks. But this is just a matter of time. This is just scratching the surface on the potential of ML and AI. I am so passionate about these possibilities that I quit my job last year to focus on studying AI. That passion, along with my decades of experience in financial services, including banking, payments, and treasury management, tells me I can add tons of value in this role. So when I saw this role combining AI innovation with internal financial systems at a company whose mission I believe in, it felt like a perfect fit. I could not believe an ML partner was there, as if maybe more than 3% of ML community was aware of this fact. It was world-famous back then.

      "transcription={'text': \" Why Stripe? Well, the mission of increasing the GDP of the internet and the key role Stripe plays for small companies in particular really resonate with me. And here is why. The last several years have been all about big tech, right? Particularly the largest players, the Magnificent Seven. That's nice because I have some Nvidia shares. But in the long term, that kind of concentration of economic growth is not good for the country or the world. This is something Patrick and John Collison probably agree with because I saw them talking about that in a podcast. But I believe that we're entering a new era where AI will enable smaller companies and startups to compete more effectively and regain their key role in the economy. Stripe's role in providing these businesses with trust and access to enterprise-grade financial infrastructure will be critical in this new era. In other words, we need Stripe to ensure that the benefits of AI spread across the entire world. So that's at a high level. In terms of the specific role, there are a couple of things I love. First, this position focuses on internal customers in finance, accounting, and treasury. And I am sure some people may strongly prefer having external customers, more standard products.

It's the exact same model as large-v3, except that the number of decoding layers have reduced from 32 to 4. As a result, the model is way faster, at the expense of a minor quality degradation. \n",

believe that we're entering a new era where ai will enable smaller companies and start-ups to compete more effectively and regain their key role in the economy stripe's role in providing these businesses with trust and access to enterprise grade financial infrastructure will be critical in this new era in other words we need stripe to ensure that the benefits of ai spread across the entire economy not just to the magnificent seven so that's at a high level in terms of the specific role there are a couple of things i love first this position focuses on internal customers in finance accounting and treasury and i am sure some people may strongly prefer having external customers more standard products but you know what throughout my career i've found that the kind of intimacy you can build with internal customers is very special you get to really understand their needs and that can lead to very impactful and long-lasting solutions at pnc for example i developed a custom crm system for the trade finance team that they loved so much they kept using it for 15 years so having internal customers is actually a positive for me second i think ai will drive most of the product innovation in the next 10 years this is going to be true everywhere but particularly in financial services where data plays such a key role i have seen early results of this at amazon where the team used machine learning to build a cash forecasting tool that blew the old tool out of the water and ran in 30 mins instead of eight hours that tool won the adam smith award for best cash flow forecasting solution in 2023 you can check it out and i personally envisioned machine learning tools to detect anomalies in the timing and the content of bank statements coming from banks but this is just scratching the surface on the potential of ml and ai i am so passionate about this possibilities that i quit my job last year to focus on studying ai that passion along with my decades of experience in financial services including banking payments and treasury management tells me i can add tons of value in this role so when i saw this role combining ai innovation with internal

      "text=\" Why Stripe? Well, the mission of increasing the GDP of the Internet and the key role Stripe plays for small companies in particular really resonate with me, and here is why. The last several years have been all about big tech, right? Particularly the largest players, the Magnificent Seven. That's nice because I have some Nvidia shares, but in the long term, that kind of concentration of economic growth is not good for the country or the world. This is something Patrick and John Collison probably agree with because I saw them talking about that in a podcast. But I believe that we're entering a new era where AI will enable smaller companies and startups to compete more effectively and regain their key role in the economy. Stripe's role in providing these businesses with trust and access to enterprise-grade financial infrastructure will be critical in this new era. In other words, we need Stripe to ensure that the benefits of AI spread across the entire economy, not just to the magnificent 7. So that's at a high level. In terms of the specific role, there are a couple of things I love. First, this position focuses on internal customers in finance, accounting, and treasury. And I am sure some people may strongly prefer having external customers, more standard products. But you know what? Throughout my career, I've found that the kind of intimacy you can build with internal customers is very special. You get to really understand their needs and that can lead to very impactful and long-lasting solutions. At PNC, for example, I developed a custom CRM system for the trade finance team that they loved so much. They kept using it for 15 years. So having internal customers is actually a positive for me. Second, I think AI will drive most of the product innovation in the next 10 years. This is going to be true everywhere, but particularly in financial services, where data plays such a key role. I have seen early results of this at Amazon, where the team used machine learning to build a cash forecasting tool that blew the old tool out of the water, and ran in 30 minns instead of eight hours. That tool won the Adam Smith Award for Best Cash Flow Forecasting Solution in 2023. You can check it out. And I personally envisioned machine learning tools to detect anomalies in the timing and the content of bank statements coming from banks. But this is just scratching the surface on the potential of ML and AI. I am so passionate about this possibilities that I quit my job last year to focus on studying AI. That passion, along with my decades of experience in financial services, including banking, payments, and treasury management, tells me I can add tons of value in this role.

      "   Why Stripe? Well, the mission of increasing the GDP of the Internet and the key role Stripe plays for small companies in particular really resonate with me, and here is why. The last several years have been all about big tech, right? Particularly the largest players, the Magnificent Seven. That's nice because I have some Nvidia shares, but in the long term, that kind of concentration of economic growth is not good for the country or the world. This is something Patrick and John Collison probably agree with because I saw them talking about that in a podcast. But I believe that we're entering a new era where AI will enable smaller companies and startups to compete more effectively and regain their key role in the economy. Stripe's role in providing these businesses with trust and access to enterprise-grade financial infrastructure will be critical in this new era. In other words, we need Stripe to ensure that the benefits of AI spread across the entire economy, not just to the magnificent 7. So that's at a high level. In terms of the specific role, there are a couple of things I love. First, this position focuses on internal customers in finance, accounting, and treasury. And I am sure some people may strongly prefer having external customers, more standard products. But you know what? Throughout my career, I've found that the kind of intimacy you can build with internal customers is very special. You get to really understand their needs and that can lead to very impactful and long-lasting solutions. At PNC, for example, I developed a custom CRM system for the trade finance team that they loved so much. They kept using it for 15 years. So having internal customers is actually a positive for me. Second, I think AI will drive most of the product innovation in the next 10 years. This is going to be true everywhere, but particularly in financial services, where data plays such a key role. I have seen early results of this at Amazon, where the team used machine learning to build a cash forecasting tool that blew the old tool out of the water, and ran in 30 minns instead of eight hours. That tool won the Adam Smith Award for Best Cash Flow Forecasting Solution in 2023. You can check it out. And I personally envisioned machine learning tools to detect anomalies in the timing and the content of bank statements coming from banks. But this is just scratching the surface on the potential of ML and AI. I am so passionate about this possibilities that I quit my job last year to focus on studying AI. That passion, along with my decades of experience in financial services, including banking, payments, and treasury management, tells me I can add tons of value in this role. So when I saw this role combining AI innovation with internal financial systems at a company whose mission I believe in, it felt like a perfect fit.\n",
